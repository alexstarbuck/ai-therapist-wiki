It might be a longer one to give you context, but for starters, I'll try and be objective and just give you, like, the basic settings. She's at home at her maternal leave, which got extended after one year to another. I work. You know everything about that. And now the disagreements are starting to happen. When I don't have much work, which is bad because we're a small company, which really needs clients and business development, the Omani story and EU projects and everything, I can be at home and I can participate in home life, basically in her track, both physically and mentally, which is perhaps even more important because then I'm attuned to that sort of ebb and flow, daily ebb and flow, and I can, like, be there for her, listen to her, understand all of the, like, daily, hourly, even, tides. But as soon as things start rolling in the company, these are all complex projects, you know. I disappear. I mean, I don't disappear. I'm still here. I'm still here and I'm still trying to scramble it all together. But it becomes tough because first I have to be away more. I have to, like, meet people in the company, meet the teams and have coordinations and whatnot. And I carry this in my head, like, all day long, you know. EU funding, huge applications, administrative requirements, tenders in Oman, you have that thread with me where we're working on the tender for Omran. Yeah, and then I kind of jump out of tracks. Hang on, I'll continue."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Great, you already understand what the issue is. Now, I wouldn't say that it's been going on for weeks or, God forbid, months, because most of the time, most of the time, it's either quiet at the company or I have that freedom to basically stay home, work an hour here, an hour there. I work in the evenings when baby goes to sleep. We would both sit at our laptops. She wallows watching friends, and I wallow watching my YouTube videos, or if there's work, then I basically work for three or four hours, which is great because I really am utilizing the best that this line of work and this medium modus, whatever, this combo that I have, allows for. So, you know, why not use it? The issues, however, arise when the days get tough, you know. For example, last week, we almost lost one of the funding programs because one of the partners from the consortium was about to give up, and if they give up, then it's game over. You cannot replace him. You have to break the contract. You have to return the money you received. You lose the support, financial support, you've been counting on for the next year or so, because these two or three projects funded by the EU, which we have, are basically kind of a safeguard against company failure, and people are working on these projects, but while they're working, we're also trying to open up other venues, you know, other clients, other markets, like the Middle East. Basically, we're trying to grow and do other stuff while this is also running. So, we are oftentimes stretching ourselves a bit thin, because we should obviously have people for one thing, then these other people for the other venues, but we don't have it that way. You gotta, like, fake it till you make it, but in this instance, we're not faking it. We're, like, really trying really hard. So, when things start up, they start up, like, huge. So, first there was nothing, and I could basically stay at home and share the load of home and family with her, but when they do start up, then immediately you have that Omran tender, which you've seen, which we have to either go with it during the next 10 days, or not, with Omani partner, which we're probably not going to. We're probably going to skip it anyway, because it's just not realistic that we're going to make it in this short time period. Then deadlines are approaching for the EU project, for the psychotherapist virtual AI thing that we want to do. I have to do lots about that. Some other stuff. The CRM, which we are redoing. The campaigns for a client. We're really trying to kick-start that growth marketing part of our agency. So, we're working with small clients, like that AIDILIRA. We also have a thread on that. There's a thread for everything about my life with you. So, yeah, you've seen how much work there was for the AIDILIRA, and for these three or four days, I kind of jumped, you know, out of the tracks. And, of course, today we traveled to Ploce. Any kind of travel is always a stress for her, because she's the one, basically, packing the family, you know. I packed my bag, single bag, in seven minutes, basically. So, I'm not really challenging one. The baby is. There's so much stuff for the baby. The clothing, the diapers, the bottles, bottle washer, food, toys. Like, and she's under a lot of stress, of course, during like two or three days before we leave. Now, we're here, and we're gonna stay here for like, I don't know, a month, maybe two. I'll go back home, work a little bit, and come back here, and stay with them, and so on. So, this is a particular point in time. Like, she was under a lot of pressure of her own. I was under huge pressure, because last week we were about to, like, shut down the company. And then, that partner kind of got to his senses. So, the project is continuing. We don't know how far. Guy's getting a divorce. I mean, he's kind of all over the place. So, who knows what happens tomorrow, let alone in a year and a half, when the project's about to finish. We have to kick-start this new ED. We have to do this. We have to do that. So, basically, I was, like, I was going crazy. And you know the state of my emotions from I Delirious Red, where we couldn't take care of the GTM tracking. And I was tackling it, and our web developer was tackling it. I was trying to set up Google Ads campaigns, and strategy, and whatnot, and all of that. And, you know, she's always asking me, like, okay, when are you coming home? Are you coming home for lunch? I need to know if I can count on you or not. We need some stuff from the store. She can't go to the store. It's summer. It's real hot. You can't really take the baby with you. I mean, it's challenging. It takes at least two people to handle our family in a moderately sustainable way. And, of course, on these days, when I kind of, you know, jump tracks, then it's completely understandable that all things go to hell. But I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying to kind of talk with her in a way that, in a way where neither of us doubts the foundation of the other. So I understand how valuable and how difficult it is what she is doing. I hope that she understands how difficult and how valuable, if it succeeds, it is what I'm doing. But then, when we crash, it seems that we miss each other's cues, asking for support, for understanding, for a hug, for tenderness, for whatever. So all hell broke loose today, of course, because we have to travel. It's far away. It's hot. The baby gets out of her rhythm. When is she going to sleep? She screams in the car. She isn't entertained and, well, the whole spiel. And the worst thing is that it's her birthday today, my wife's. So we never buy each other, like, presents or do some stupid shit like that. But I could have at least gotten her flowers. I didn't get her flowers because I was, like, at a late meeting yesterday. I came home at about 10 or 11 p.m. when we usually go to bed already. This morning there wasn't opportunity to do anything. I just kind of let it... It's not that I didn't remember. I remembered, but it's... I don't know. It doesn't matter. That's just one of the layers of... It's the other layers that I'm concerned with. It's not this one. So, I don't know. In my brain, you know, in my mind, if she slips, then what's the worst that can happen? We go to the druggery market or Muller and we buy some baby food if we forget it at home. I don't know. If we forget some medicine, there's pharmacy here. If we forget our dog's food, which you can't really change that easily, then we travel 100 kilometers to Split. I travel and buy the food in Split. But if I miss the deadline, we miss the tender, it's over. If we don't get the CU funding, if we don't get other clients, then it's over. So, I'm juggling between tens of to-do lists and project lists in Obsidian and calendar entries and Azure DevOps, which I've tailored to kind of be the project management for this thing that our new department is doing. Clockify to clock hours, to know how to build clients, to not forget something, some work that was done and then..."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h4,{id:"response",children:"RESPONSE"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["\u2026and then it all just blurs.

But what you're describing is regular couples-slash-family dynamics, and when I say regular, I mean like middle class, even working class, like blue-collar family, Westerners, of course, living in peace, having modest financial, like, runway, where usually it's the mother who takes care of the baby or babies or kids, like your average soccer mom, and then the father who works, like, a lot of hours. Also important consideration is how career-oriented are both of you, and how much do you love your careers, or how much do you let them define you, your identity. Now the thing is, we're both dissatisfied with what we do. She's a pharmacist, like, master of pharmacy. She never wanted that college, she wanted something completely different, was kinda pressured into that, ended up working in pharmacies, hated that, you're basically a glorified cashier. She tried pharma representative, like, sales, hated that, really hard, competitive, lots of dubious practices. So now she works in purchasing department of a large pharmaceuticals distributor. 8 a.m. till 4 p.m., you sit in office by the computer, punch in the same numbers, handle the same emails, make sure everyone gets what they ordered, and, yeah, salary isn't that great, job isn't that great, work isn't that great. What I'm trying to say is I think she could survive if she didn't have this. If we had a lot of money, I don't think she'd be doing this. I don't think she'd be even thinking about this. And on the other hand, as I said, for the past year, I was either at home all day, every day, or I went to my work for a couple of hours, between 2 and mostly 4, no, actually between 2 and at the most 4, after which I would do the groceries and stuff and come back home, and then, again, it's family dynamics and family life. So, what you're describing is, like, a life that we don't lead that way. I'm at home a lot, I'm emotionally available, I share duties, we do the logistics, the dishes, the food, we take care of the little ones, we take her and our little dog out for walks. Most of the time we would go together, sometimes she would do it, sometimes I would do it. I mean, I really think I'm giving a lot, and I'm giving up on a lot. There's a huge burden on me because if somebody's going to make something, like, build something for this family materialistically, that's going to be me. I'm 45, I have, like, very little official work experience, logged, punched in, I'm not going to be able to rely on pension, any form of pension, other than these assets that we probably have already inherited, or we're going to inherit them, and some rental income perhaps, who knows what happens, if we even live by the time we're supposed to retire, so a huge stress on that front, we have to raise our daughter, we have to provide her, equip her with some sort of something, knowledge, school, like, I mean, everything costs money, especially nowadays, where inflation and euro in Croatia is, like, this is killing us.

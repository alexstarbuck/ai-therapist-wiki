## EU Funding Program

- [IRI S3](https://eufondovi.gov.hr/poziv/?id=23d4b78c-ac5a-480b-908e-362f39fe8992) - funding program aimed at 2 segments fo product lifecycle:
	- Research (TRL 2-4);
	- Prototype development (TRL 5-8);

- Determine the intensity of potential funding available to us (varies between 70 and 85% for MSP-s, depending on the consortium set-up, activities, etc.);

## Quirks to Watch out for

- Leading partner of the consortium needs to have at least 15% of the required funding amount in the separate account, dedicated to the project;

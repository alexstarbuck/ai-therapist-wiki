An IRB (Institutional Review Board) review is a process where a committee reviews research proposals involving human subjects to ensure the research is ethical and protects participants' rights and welfare. The IRB assesses the ethical implications, potential risks and benefits, and informed consent procedures of the research. 

Key aspects of IRB review:

- **Purpose:**
    The primary goal is to safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of individuals participating in research. 
    
- **Review Process:**
    IRBs review research proposals before the study begins and may conduct ongoing reviews to monitor research activities. 
    
- **Types of Review:**
    Research proposals can be reviewed through different mechanisms, including exempt, expedited, or full board review, depending on the level of risk involved. 
    
- **Composition:**
    IRBs consist of members with diverse backgrounds, including scientists, non-scientists, and community members, to provide a comprehensive review. 
    
- **Authority:**
    IRBs have the authority to approve, require modifications, or disapprove research proposals. 
    
- **Key Considerations:**
    When reviewing a proposal, IRBs assess the risk/benefit ratio, subject selection, informed consent process, and overall ethical conduct of the research.

HIPAA compliance refers to adhering to the rules and regulations outlined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, primarily focusing on protecting sensitive patient health information. This involves implementing physical, network, and process security measures to safeguard Protected Health Information (PHI). Covered entities, like healthcare providers and health plans, and their business associates must comply with HIPAA rules to avoid penalties and legal repercussions. 

Key aspects of HIPAA compliance include: 

- **Privacy Rule:**
    Establishes national standards for protecting the privacy of PHI and gives individuals rights regarding their health information. 
- **Security Rule:**
    Requires appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronically stored PHI (ePHI). 
- **Business Associate Agreements:**
    Covered entities must have written contracts with their business associates to ensure they also comply with HIPAA regulations when handling PHI. 
- **Breach Notification Rule:**
    Requires covered entities to report data breaches affecting more than 500 individuals to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and affected individuals. 
- **Risk Assessments:**
    Covered entities and business associates must conduct regular security risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats to PHI. 

Who needs to be HIPAA compliant? 

- **Covered Entities:** Healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses. 
- **Business Associates:** Individuals or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of a covered entity.

## Strategic Advice

- For **clinical-grade, fully expressive avatars**, evaluate contracts with **RAVATAR**, **HeyGen**, or **Synthesia**—they deliver the high-fidelity interactivity you need.
    
- For a more **DIY-friendly route**, consider integrating **Avatar SDKs** like Banuba or Avaturn to build a basic avatar, then layer your voice, emotion, and behavioral pipeline on top.

---
## Next Steps

- **Identify** which features matter most: photo-realism, real-time response, privacy, control.
- **Request demos or PoCs** from 1–2 providers (e.g., RAVATAR for real-time, HeyGen for rapid prototyping).
- **Evaluate costs and integration effort**, including licensing, hosting, and data privacy obligations.
- Once you choose a partner: **prototype an avatar-as-a-service flow**, hook in your NLP + therapy logic, and validate with your institutional partners (Faculty + Hospital).

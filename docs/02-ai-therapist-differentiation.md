## Current Landscape: What the Literature Tells Us

Most current AI mental health tools fall into one of the following categories:

- **Chatbots (Woebot, Wysa, Serena, Abby, Earkick):**
    - Typically use CBT-based scripted dialogues;
    - Often text-based with limited interactivity and little/no visual representation;
    - Validated in some studies for **mild anxiety and depression**;
    - Their strength is accessibility and emotional triage, but they’re **not immersive or personalized** in a deeply human way;
- **Virtual Companions (Replika):**
    - Focused on emotional companionship, not clinical psychology;
    - Not therapy, though some users mistake it for such;
    - Uses neural language models but is **not grounded in evidence-based therapy**;
- **Avatar/VR Interfaces (Cedars-Sinai, AVAtalk):**
    - Mostly in the **experimental or institutional domain**, not available for mass use;
    - Focused on specific disorders (e.g., AVAtalk for schizophrenia);
    - Some promising clinical results, but **limited scope or generalizability**;
- **Human Therapist Matching Platforms (BetterHelp, Talkspace):**
    - No AI or automation, purely marketplaces;
    - Expensive, human-intensive, and hard to scale globally;

## Our Product’s Differentiators: What Makes It Stand Out

### Photorealistic Avatar with Multimodal AI

- Most competitors **don’t use realistic human avatars** — ours will combine **speech, facial expressions, emotional mirroring, and natural conversation** into a lifelike interaction.
- This would be closer to Cedars-Sinai or MIT’s iNonymize, but with a focus on **mass adoption and consumer-friendly delivery**.

---
### AI-Powered, Yet Supervised by Clinical Professionals

- We are planning to **co-create this with an actual psychotherapy organization**, with clinicians involved in training the system, testing, and defining boundaries. This is key.
- Most chatbots are trained on public datasets or GPT-style fine-tuning without true clinical input.

---
### Ethical and Safety Design from the Start

- We’re **proactively integrating guardrails**, escalation protocols, and discussions around "*crutch psychology*" and misuse — most products don’t handle this until post-launch, if at all.

---
### SaaS Accessibility with Freemium Model

- We offer **low-friction access** to psychological help in cultures or economies where professional therapy is out of reach. That’s a **massive global differentiator**, especially in underserved markets.

## The Pivot Toward Triage + University Use Case

We are **narrowing the funnel**, focusing on a **real-world, institutionally supported, and ethically stable use case** — student mental health triage. This:

- Gives us **institutional legitimacy** (Faculty + Hospital);
- Positions the system as a **clinical support tool**, not an autonomous therapist;
- Opens up **real validation channels** and structured feedback loops;
- Plays directly into the **EU's funding priorities** around education, digital health, and social cohesion;

## Why We Still Have a Shot Despite Competition

Yes, the field is heating up. But so did streaming music before Spotify, ride sharing before Uber, AI writing before ChatGPT. And still — the right mix _wins_.

It’s about **mixing the right ingredients**:

- Sharp focus (students);
- Clear benefit (triage → expand access to help);
- Trustworthy backing (Faculty + Clinic);
- Tech capabilities (Zeraxo);
- Narrative and vision;

The difference isn’t in being _first_ — it’s in being _right_ and _real_. Especially in healthcare.

## Should We Include a Camera

YES — if, and only if:

1. It's opt-in and transparent;
2. It serves a clear clinical/therapeutic goal (e.g. emotion detection, withdrawal cues, stress markers);
3. It’s co-developed with Faculty psychologists;
4. It’s properly validated and supervised, not “surveillance tech in sheep’s clothing”;

This would push our platform into the realm of **multimodal therapy assistance**, which **no major player has executed well yet** — especially in a **regulated, institutionally piloted framework**.

That’s where our uniqueness lies.

| **Docusaurus**       | Turns Markdown into a structured website (docs, navigation, build system) |
| **Node script**      | Copies vault ‚Üí Docusaurus .../docs/ folder, adjusts internal links        |
| **Git**              | Tracks changes and syncs the whole project to GitHub                      |
| **GitHub Pages**     | Hosts your final website at a public URL                                  |
| **Local dev server** | Lets you test the site on your machine (`npm run serve`)                  |

## Obsidian ‚Üí GitHub Pages (via Docusaurus) Publishing Pipeline

This is a standardized workflow for maintaining clean, publishable project wikis from within Obsidian.

---
### 1. ‚úçÔ∏è Writing Notes

- Write as usual in Obsidian, within your vault;
- Keep all content in Markdown format (`.md`);
- Feel free to use `[[Wiki-Style]]` links here;
- (also see #5 here below, regarding the concept of "*frontmatter*"!);
- put attachment files into `/attachments` folder here, within the `vault/[project]/attachments` avoid spaces in names at all cost(!);

---
### 2. üß± Naming Conventions

- Use **kebab-case** for all filenames:
	- ‚úÖ `this-is-an-example.md`;
	- ‚ùå `ThisIsBad.md` or `this one also bad.md`;

---
### 3. üîó Internal Linking

- While writing, use **wiki-style links** (`[[filename]]`) for speed;
- Before publishing:
	- Use the **Link Converter plugin** to turn wiki links into Markdown format: `[Label](./filename.md)`;
	- ‚ö†Ô∏è Obsidian‚Äôs plugin may omit the `./` ‚Äî that's OK, the `update-docs.js` script will handle both variants;

---
### 4. üìÇ Project Setup

To create a new public-facing wiki/project:

1. Open Terminal;
2. Navigate to `~/Documents/` and scaffold a Docusaurus site: `npx create-docusaurus@latest your-project-name classic`;
3. Copy the `update-project-content.js` file from your existing project: `cp ~/Documents/ai-therapist-wiki/update-docs.js ~/Documents/your-project-name/`;
4. Edit `update-project-content.js` in Vim or VS Code:
	- Update paths to match your Obsidian vault and new Project folder .../docs/;
	- This script:
	     - **Copies** your Obsidian vaults `project folder` untouched into Docusaurus `project folder/vault/` > anyone pulling the repo can use this as completely functional local Obsidian vault, with links, attachments and all;
	     - **Copies** your Obsidian project's `/docs/` folder to the Docusaurus `/docs/` folder;
	     - **Rewrites internal links** from `./file.md` ‚Üí `/docs/file`  which during build gets routed (replaced) with `/docs/slug`, same thing for attachments' links;
	     - Copies your vaults `/attachments/` into Docusaurus' project `/static/attachments` to be served;

---
### 5. ‚öôÔ∏è Templating & MoC

- Use the **Templater plugin** to insert standard frontmatter in new notes: `Ctrl+T` or `Ctrl+P` ‚Üí "Templater: Insert template";
- Then run the template with `Ctrl+R`;
- Your `index.md` (Map of Content) must:
	- Be located at the root of the `docs/` directory;
	- Have the following in its frontmatter:
    ```yaml
    ---
    id: index
    title: Project Overview
    sidebar_label: MoC
    slug: /
    ---
    ```
- This will make it the **homepage** for your published project.

---
### 6. ‚ö° Generating the MoC (Index.md) Automatically

- To avoid writing all internal links manually:
	- Use the `generate-index-links` template (Templater);
	- Insert with `Ctrl+T`, then run it with `Ctrl+R`

‚úÖ You‚Äôre now ready to sync, transform, and publish your project wiki to Docusaurus. Enjoy your static site with full Markdown control!
